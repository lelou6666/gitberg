Her marriage in 1836 to James Swisshelm, a Methodist farmer's son, resulted in continual conflict with her husband's family, who sought to convert her to their own beliefs. After a few years in Louisville, Kentucky, where Swisshelm observed slavery first-hand, she left her husband to nurse her mother in Pittsburgh. She wrote several articles for the antislavery Spirit of Liberty and the Pittsburgh Commercial Journal, then in 1848 started her own anti-slavery newspaper, the Pittsburg Saturday Visiter [sic]. Her views on slavery, women's issues, and the Mexican- American War soon attracted a national readership. In 1856 she started another abolitionist paper, the Democrat, and began to lecture frequently on slavery and the legal disabilities of women. She opposed those who advocated leniency for the leaders of the 1862 Sioux uprising, and took her cause to Washington, D.C., on the advice of state officials. While there she secured a position nursing wounded Union soldiers and raising supplies for their benefit. Her narrative ends with her discharge and retirement to an old log block house on ten acres of her husband's family holdings."},

On none had the religious changes fallen with more severity than on the Maxwell family that lived in the Hall, at the upper and southern end of the green. Old Sir Nicholas, though his convictions had survived the tempest of unrest and trouble that had swept over England, and he had remained a convinced and a stubborn Catholic, yet his spiritual system was sore and inflamed within him. To his simple and obstinate soul it was an irritating puzzle as to how any man could pass from the old to a new faith, and he had been known to lay his whip across the back of a servant who had professed a desire to try the new religion. Although written over a hundred years ago at the time of the Elizabethan persecution of \"papists\", it rings true even today where it is considered \"with it\" to denounce the Catholic Church."},

They not only elucidate the history of those industrious animals whose properties are the peculiar subject of investigation, but they present some new and singular features in physiology, which have hitherto been unknown, and even unsuspected. The industry of bees has proved a fertile source of admiration in all countries, and in every age, and mankind have unremittingly endeavoured to render it subservient either to their gratifications or emolument. Hence, innumerable theories, experiments, and observations have ensued, and uncommon patience has been displayed in prosecuting the enquiry. But although many interesting peculiarities have been discovered, they are so unaccountably interwoven with errors, that no subject has given birth to more absurdities than investigations into the history of bees; and unfortunately those treatises which are the most easily attained, and at this day, the most popular, only serve to give them a wider range, and to render it infinitely more difficult for the philosophic naturalist to eradicate them. A considerable portion of the following work is devoted to this purpose; and it belongs to the reader to judge of the success which has resulted from the experiments that have been employed\"--Pr\u00e9face."},

Published by Doubleday in 1900, the novel was altered to make it more palatable to the audiences of the day, which caused Dreiser considerable anguish. It nevertheless gained a reputation as a shocker, for Dreiser had dared to give to the world a heroine whose \"cosmopolitan standard of virtue\" brings her from Wisconsin, with four dollars in her purse, to a suite at the Waldorf and glittering fame as an actress. With Sister Carrie, Dreiser told a tale not sufficiently delicate for many of its first readers and critics, but which is now universally recognized as one of the greatest and most influential of American novels."},

The earliest citizen of the young nation to support himself by 'the profession of literature, ' Brown used the American scene as background for his fiction. Arthur Mervyn, his third published novel, has long puzzled students and scholars with its seeming diffuseness, resulting from its original serial publication. Critics agree, however, that the power of this novel lies not so much in its portrait of 'right virtue, ' which was Brown's primary aim, as in its realistic descriptions of the yellow fever epidemic and the ensuing panic that swept Philadelphia in the summer of 1793. The ambiguities of Arthur Mervyn's character and the precarious nature of the revolutionary 1790s make this novel a particularly apt subject for lively discussion and future scholarship and make this revised edition an excellent classroom text. This paperback edition reprints the novel's text and historical overview of Volume III of the highly regarded Bicentennial Edition of The Novels of Charles Brockden Brown, edited by Sydney J.

Summer is the story of proud and independent Charity Royall, a child of mountain moonshiners adopted by a family in a poor New England town, who has a passionate love affair with Lucius Harney, an educated young man from the city. Wharton broke the conventions of woman's romantic fiction by making Charity a thoroughly contemporary woman, in touch with her feelings and sexuality, yet kept from love and the larger world she craves by the overwhelming pressures of environment and heredity. Praised for its realism and candor by such writers as Joseph Conrad and Henry James and compared to Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Summer was one of Wharton's personal favorites of all her novels and remains as fresh and relevant today as when it was first written."},

Through characters ranging from schemers to preachers, Paul Laurence Dunbar crafted a rare snapshot of long-lost communities and their poignant sensibilities. An author who achieved remarkable versatility, he draws on language that is by turns folksy and formal, putting forth controversial vernacular dialects as easily as he delivers a hauntingly poetic scene. In this collection, readers meet an influential entrepreneur who must navigate a treacherous political landscape; a Southern spiritual leader who must learn to accept the mores of his son, who was educated in the North; a reporter who restores hope in Santa Claus to a group of destitute siblings; and a host of other unique men and women giving voice to timeless themes.Dunbar's work has deservingly experienced a recent revival among commercial and scholarly audiences alike, and noted scholar Eleanor Alexander, author of the critically acclaimed biography Lyrics of Sunshine and Shadow: The Courtship and Marriage of Paul Laurence Dunbar and Alice Ruth Moore further contextualizes Dunbar's contributions to American letters. A captivating read, The Heart of Happy Hollow will introduce more book lovers to this revered storyteller and visionary."},

Clarke's Hal in 2001 ten years later) is gifted with a human and very cranky personality. By 1958, the Horace Gold's own personality, under the constant pressure of his agoraphobia, isolation and increasing imperiousness had sharply deteriorated and he had alienated most of his best contributors, some of whom (Isaac Asimov) refused to work with him any more. Gold, the editor of GALAXY magazine, between 1950 and 1959 apparently never left his Stuyvesant Town apartment for any reason. Gold was having ever less to do with the mechanical and repetitive aspects of editing and, probably at the best of his publisher Robert Guinn had turned over those tasks (and some of the task of selection) to Frederik Pohl who was in effect ghost-editing the magazine years before he assumed the position of editor on the masthead in 1960. Perhaps not coincidentally, Pohl became in those years one of the magazine's most prolific contributors, even as the already dominant Robert Sheckley under Pohl's guidance became so prolific that he developed three pseudonyms because so frequently more than one of his stories appeared in the magazine. THE KNIGHTS OF ARTHUR is a characteristic GALAXY satire of a machine pushing the borders of restraint and becoming a bully or at least something of an oppressor. (Robert Silverberg's THE IRON CHANCELLOR, also part of The Galaxy Project is another such example.) Pohl's pleasantly ravaged, post-apocalyptic city is more than background landscape; it is itself a character (just as New York City was essentially the protagonist of Pohl's great novel YEARS OF THE CITY published three decades earlier). Pohl's work was usually more inferno than comic but this novelette is managed with unaccustomed lightness."},

The particular editor who took Verrian's serial, after it had come back to the author from the editors of the other leading periodicals, was in fact moved mainly by the belief that the story would please the better sort of his readers. These, if they were not so numerous as the worse, he felt had now and then the right to have their pleasure studied. It was a serious story, and it was somewhat bitter, as Verrian himself was, after his struggle to reach the public with work which he knew merited recognition. But the world which does not like people to take themselves too seriously also likes them to take themselves seriously, and the bitterness in Verrian's story proved agreeable to a number of readers unexpectedly great. It intimated a romantic personality in the author, and the world still likes to imagine romantic things of authors. It likes especially to imagine them of novelists, now that there are no longer poets; and when it began to like Verrian's serial, it began to write him all sorts of letters, directly, in care of the editor, and indirectly to the editor, whom they asked about Verrian more than about his story."},

The excitement has left Lanyard&mdash;or Monsieur Duchemin, as the British government prefers to know him&mdash;feeling slow and cranky. There is nothing to do, suggests Wertheimer, but retire from undercover work and leave England for good.

{"identifier": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8600", "description": "The seventh novel in the Rougon-Macquart cycle, L'Assommoir (1877), is the story of a woman's struggle for happiness in working-class Paris. It was a contemporary bestseller, outraged conservative critics, and launched a passionate debate about the legitimate scope of modern literature. At the centre of the novel stands Gervaise, who starts her own laundry and for a time makes a success of it. But her husband Coupeau squanders her earnings in the Assommoir, the local drinking shop, and gradually the pair sink into poverty and squalor. L'Assommoir is the most finely crafted of Zola's novels, and this new translation captures not only the brutality but also the pathos of its characters' lives. This book is a powerful indictment of nineteenth-century social conditions, and the Introduction examines its relation to politics and art as well as its explosive effect on the literary scene."},

Castle Rackrent's narrator, Thady Quirk, gives us four generations of Rackrent heirs - Sir Patrick, the dissipated spendthrift; Sir Murtagh, the litigating fiend; Sir Kit, the brutal husband and gambling absentee; and Sir Condy, the lovable and improvident dupe of Thady's own son, Jason. With this satire on Anglo-Irish landlords Edgeworth pioneered the regional novel and inspired Sir Walter Scott's Waverley (1814).

Also when a woman is created, the winds have wooed star-dust, rose-dew, peach-down, and a few flint-shavings into a whirlwind of deviltry, and the world at large looks on in wonder and sore amazement, as well as breathless interest. I know, because I am one, and have just been waked up by the gyrations of the cyclone; and I'm deeply confounded.

The subject-matter of the remaining seven is the unfolding of the spirit [or spiritual nature] of man, in consciousness and in science; in external life and its great social relations; in its struggle with the age; and in its course of restoration through the several grades of human development, until it arrives at the end and aim of perfection. The second section of this book presents Lectures on the Philosophy of Language.\" (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)."},

They settled first in New Bedford and then in Lawrence, Massachusetts, finally migrating in 1859 to a pioneer farmstead in northern Michigan, where Anna performed much of the subsistence labor during her father's long absences. The first part of her narrative emphasizes her efforts to gain an education and take up a ministerial career. After two years at Albion College, she attended Boston Theological School (1876-1878) and accepted a pastorate in East Dennis, Cape Cod, after graduation; later she also took temporary charge of the Congregational Church in Dennis. After her ordination had been blocked by members of the New England Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church opposed to ordaining women, Shaw was ordained by the 1880 Conference of the Methodist Protestant Church in Tarrytown, N.Y."},

The talks now printed form the substance of that course, which has since then been delivered at various places to various teacher-audiences. I have found by experience that what my hearers seem least to relish is analytical technicality, and what they most care for is concrete practical application. So I have gradually weeded out the former, and left the latter unreduced; and, now that I have at last written out the lectures, they contain a minimum of what is deemed 'scientific' in psychology, and are practical and popular in the extreme. My main desire has been to make teachers conceive, and if possible, reproduce sympathetically in their imagination, the mental life of their pupil as the sort of active unity which he/she feels it to be. Readers acquainted with my larger books on Psychology will meet much familiar phraseology. The talks to students, which conclude the volume, were written in response to invitations to deliver 'addresses' to students at women's colleges. The first one was to the graduating class of the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics. Properly, it continues the series of talks to teachers. The second and the third address belong together, and continue another line of thought\"--Pref. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved)."},

This state of things sounds hardly enviable, but Lucian, being young and independent to the extent of L300 a year, was not dissatisfied with his position. As his age was only twenty-five, there was ample time, he thought, to succeed in his profession; and, pending that desirable consummation, he cultivated the muses on a little oatmeal, after the fashion of his kind. There have been lives less happily circumstanced. Geneva Square was a kind of backwater of the great river of town life which swept past its entrance with speed and clamour without disturbing the peace within. One long, narrow street led from a roaring thoroughfare into a silent quadrangle of tall grey houses, occupied by lodging-house keepers, city clerks and two or three artists, who represented the Bohemian element of the place.

In the wagons lay fourteen or fifteen thousand wounded soldiers, but they made little noise, as the wheels sank suddenly in the mud or bumped over stones. Although the vast majority of them were young, boys or not much more, they had learned to be masters of themselves, and they suffered in silence, save when some one, lost in fever, uttered a groan. But the chief sound was a blended note made by the turning of wheels, and the hoofs of horses sinking in the soft earth. The officers gave but few orders, and the cavalrymen who rode on either flank looked solicitously into the wagons now and then to see how their wounded friends fared, though they seldom spoke. The darkness they did not mind, because they were used to it, and the rain and the coolness were a relief, after three days of the fiercest battle the American continent had ever known, fought in the hottest days that the troops could recall. Thus Lee's army drew its long length from the fatal field of Gettysburg, although his valiant brigades did not yet know that the clump of trees upon Cemetery Hill had marked the high tide of the Confederacy."},

Consciously or unconsciously, our feelings about almost everything are largely molded by ready-made opinions and attitudes fostered by our mass methods of communication. Self-hypnosis is a highly suggestible state wherein the individual can direct suggestions to himself. It is a powerful tool in any therapeutic process, and highly motivated subjects can parallel the success of hetero-hypnosis through their own efforts. Self-hypnosis can be used as a palliative agent and can even afford lasting results in many areas of the organism. Self-hypnosis can alleviate distressing symptoms, substitute strong responses for weak responses, help overcome bad habits, create good habits and help one's power of concentration. The total personality is eventually changed to the point where it can function adequately in an increasingly difficult environment."},

Behind her, hid in a hollow, stood the small cottage where, at that very moment, her grandmother was preparing the evening meal. And, beyond, in the village was the little old stone church and Father Murphy's square bit of a house with its wide doorstep and its roof of thatch, and Widow Mulligan's and the Denny's and the Finnegan's and all the others. Moira loved them all and loved the hospitable homes where there was always, in spite of poverty, a bounty of good feeling. And before her, just beyond that last steep rise, was the sea.

The author's aim is to elucidate the fundamental truths of psychology, and he describes three ways in which he tries to accomplish this goal. First, the attempt has been made to present only fundamental truths; Second, the aim has been to state these fundamental truths simply, that the student may clearly understand them; Third, it is recognized that if the student is really to make use of the psychology he learns, he must have practical and useful truths presented to him, and must be led to a comprehension of these truths through their relation to his own actual experience. The various exercises suggested at the ends of the chapters will be found useful not because they outline the respective chapters in any systematic way, but because they will encourage introspection.\" (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)."},

After her 1870 marriage to Oscar Chopin, a Creole cotton trader and commission merchant, she lived in and around New Orleans for more than a decade until her husband's death in 1882. During these years, Chopin became acquainted with Creoles, Cajuns, and newly freed blacks. When Oscar Chopin died he was nearly bankrupt, forcing Kate and their six children to return to her family in St. Louis. Still under the spell of New Orleans, Chopin began writing and her short stories about Creole and Cajun life first appeared in magazines in 1889. The stories collected in Bayou folk (1894) present remarkably vivid snapshots of daily life in a now vanished world. Many of them highlight the relations between blacks and whites in a society where the rules of engagement still reflected the entrenched patterns of slavery some two decades after the Civil War."},

Describes more than 100 common United States birds, including their physical attributes, calls, and nesting and mating habits. Originally published in 1907, Birds Every Child Should Know is a collection of storylike descriptions of more than one hundred birds commonly found in the United States. Neltje Blanchan's detailed descriptions of birds -- their physical attributes, calls, nesting and mating habits, and other behaviors -- are nothing less than enchanting, and some read almost like fairy tales. Take for instance the mockingbird's call: when the moonlight sheds a silvery radiance about every sleeping creature, the mockingbird sings to his mate such delicious music as only the European nightingale can rival. Perhaps the stillness of the hour, the beauty and fragrance of the place where the singer is hidden among the orange blossoms or magnolia, increase the magic of his almost pathetically sweet voice; but surely there is no lovelier sound in nature on this side of the sea-or the yellow warbler's nest: an exquisite little cradle of silvery plant fiber, usually shreds of milkweed stalk, grass, leaves, and caterpillar's silk, neatly lined with hair, feathers, and downy felt of fern fronds. Blanchan includes folk history (how Native Americans and southern slaves thwarted mosquitoes by hanging gourds to attract purple martins) as well as common threats to birds that foreshadow current dangers to avian life (the toll taken on songbirds by lighthouses and electric towers). Such informative details, along with the author's disarming enthusiasm for her subject, will charm adult bird-watchers as well as children. Cornelia Mutel's informative foreword places Blanchan's writing in the historical context of a turn-of-the-century environmental reawakening and burgeoning activism and research by women onbehalf of dwindling bird populations."},

Using Great Britain as his main example, he also details the Dutch fleets to demonstrate their reason for becoming a European superpower in their own right. Later he identifies the presence of the French navy, apart from any material success in its engagements, as one of the determining reasons why America had a chance to win its independence. Finally, as he hints of the supreme commercial and military importance of the proposed (Panama) canal, against the declining state of the American navy and the paltry condition of its merchant fleet, he urges that Americas prosperity if not survival depends on the powerful revival of its sea power.\" - Barnes & Nobel."},

One man, wounded and left for the buzzards, comes back to consciousness and vows to bring the killers to justice. Now known only as the Lone Ranger, this man, his steadfast horse, Silver, and trusted friend, Tonto, set out to bring justice to the men who ambushed him and his fellow rangers. With a 'Hi-Yo Silver, Away-y-y-y,' the Lone Ranger embodies classic American ideals of the champions of the Wild West. The Lone Ranger first found success as a 1933 radio show, then expanded into books, television, comics, and motion pictures. This iconic character has been portrayed George Seaton, Clayton Moore, and by Armie Hammer in the 2013 movie release The Lone Ranger (with Johnny Depp as Tonto).

It dealt with apparitions in a white sheet, and clanking chains, and dreadful faces that peered out from behind the window curtains in a haunted chamber. And the more blood-curdling it was, the more keenly people enjoyed it-until they were left alone, and then they were apt to wish that they had been reading \"Robinson Crusoe\" or Alison's \"History of Europe\" instead. Now the present book embodies an attempt to write a cheerful ghost-story; a story in which the ghostly element is of a friendly and pleasant character, and sheds a sense of happiness and sunshine over the entire life of the ghost-seer. Whether the author has succeeded in doing so will be for his readers to decide. It is only necessary to add that he has not introduced a single supernormal incident that has not occurred and been authenticated in the recorded experiences of persons lately or still alive."},

Shortly after arriving in St. Paul, Moore was employed by The Minnesotian, a paper owned and managed by his brother, George W. Moore. After a variety of jobs there he rose to become superintendent of the composing room, a position he held for more than forty years. In 1908, he celebrated his fiftieth year with the Pioneer Press, which had merged with and renamed the Minnesotian. Moore recounts life in Minnesota from the late 1850s through the close of the Civil War and the assassination of President Lincoln. He relates anecdotes from the early days of newspapers in St. Paul, especially the competition among the papers to be the first out with the \"telegraph\" news, and offers a complete account of the 1862 Sioux uprising from a settler's perspective. Moore reminisces on the development of St. Paul as an urban center, with her fire companies and amusement houses [theaters], where, he recalls, Dan Emmett, the composer of the song \"Dixie,\" had a minstrel company in the late 1850s. There is a chapter listing territorial printers and editors of Minnesota. Two other chapters deal with exploits of Minnesota units in Civil War battles: the Second Minnesota Regiment's conspicuous actions at the battle of Mill Springs, Kentucky, and the First Minnesota battery's contributions to the Union victory at the Battle of Pittsburg Landing (Shiloh) in Tennessee.

It is the sweetness of philosophical sorrow which has no kinship with misery or distress. In the strains of the saddest music the soul finds the keenest delight. The same sweet, sorrowful pleasure is felt in the play of the mind about the riddles which it cannot solve. In the presence of the infinite problem of life, the voice of Science is dumb, for Science is the coordinate and corrected expression of human experience, and human experience must stop with the limitations of human life. Man was not present \"When the foundations of the Earth were laid, \" and beyond the certainty that they were laid in wisdom and power, man can say little about them. Man finds in the economy of nature \"no trace of a beginning; no prospect of an end!\" He may feel sure, with Hutton, that \"time is as long as space is wide.\" But he cannot conceive of space as actually without limit, nor can he imagine any limiting conditions. He cannot think of a period before time began, nor of a state in which time shall be no more. The mind fails before the idea of time's eternal continuity. So time becomes to man merely the sequence of the earthly events in which he and his ancestors have taken part. Though the meaning of time, space, existence lies beyond our reach, yet some sort of solution of the infinite problem the human heart demands. We find in life a power for action, limited though this power may be. Life is action, and action is impossible if devoid of motive or hope. It is my purpose here to indicate some part of the answer of Science to the Philosophy of Despair. Direct reply Science has none. We cannot argue against a singer or a poet. The poet sings of what he feels, but Science speaks only of what we know. We feel infinity, but we cannot know it, for to the highest human wisdom the ultimate truths of the universe are no nearer than to the child. Science knows no ultimate truths. These are beyond the reach of man, and all that man knows must be stated in terms of his experience. But as to human experience and conduct, Science has a word to say. Therefore Science can speak of the causes and results of Pessimism. It can touch the practical side of the riddle of life by asking certain questions, the answers to which lie within the province of human experience. Among these are the following: Why is there a \"Philosophy of Despair?\" Can Despair be wrought into healthful life? In what part of the Universe are you and what are you doing?\" (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)."},

They have attracted me; they have moved me to reflection; they have revealed to me certain aspects of nature and of philosophy which I am prompted by mere sincerity to express, if anybody seems interested or willing to listen.? The modesty exhibited in the above disclaimer?from Santayana?s preface to Three Philosophical Poets?should be viewed in the context of the author?s extraordinary impact as a philosopher and teacher. The Sense of Beauty has claim to being the first major work on aesthetics written in the United States; the multivolume The Life of Reason is arguably the first extended analysis of pragmatism anywhere. Among Santayana?s many well-known Harvard students, Wallace Stevens has acknowledged a clear debt to his work. Based on a course Santayana taught at Harvard, Three Philosophical Poets was first delivered to the public as a series of lectures at Columbia University in 1910. Santayana?s lifelong, learned meditation on the relationship between philosophy and art is apparent. (Santayana?s own prose style has long been considered among the most eloquent in all of philosophy.) Here, he discusses the chief phases of European philosophy?naturalism, supernaturalism, and romanticism?as they are set forth and epitomized by the works of Lucretius, Dante, and Goethe, respectively. Praise for Three Philosophical Poets and its author ?[A] brilliant and admirable little book.? ?T. S. Eliot ?The exquisite and memorable way in which he has always said things has given so much delight that we accept what he says as we accept our own civilization. His pages are part of the douceur de vivre.? ?Wallace Stevens ?Santayana was the real excitement for me at Harvard, especially Three Philosophical Poets?.It really fixed my view of what poetry should ultimately be.? ?Conrad Aiken"},

Fanny Herself showcases the author's enduring interest in the capacity of strong women to transcend the limitations of their environment and control their own circumstances.

Using the architecture, sculpture, and stained glass of the two locales as a starting point, Adams breathes life into what others might see merely as monuments of a past civilization. With daring and inventive conceits, Adams looks at the ordinary people, places, and events in the context of the social conventions and systems of thought and belief of the thirteenth century, turning the study of history into a kind of theater. As Raymond Carney discusses in his introduction, Adam's freedom from the European traditions of study lends exuberance-and puckish wit-to his writings."},

Elijah Warren finds himself the guardian of his brother's children who are rapidly reaching adulthood but haven't had to face the harsh realities of self responsibility due to their father's wealth. Unfortunately now there are a few snags with A. Rodgers Warren's estate and Cap'n Warren decides its best to toughen his wards up and maybe teach them some humility in the process. Returning to his native Cape Cod village after many years of living at sea, Cy Whittaker finds the old homestead no longer the place of his boyhood. So-called \"improvements\" have been going on in his absence, and he finds it  all sadly changed. The old man adopts the little daughter of a worthless drunkard, with the intent of giving the child an education. A Congressman from the district, years before, had appropriated property belonging to the child, and he, together with the father, fights to regain possession of the child. The sympathy of the village goes out to the father, but Cy Whittaker and Phoebe Dawes, the school teacher, manage to outwit the Congressman and the drunken father, and in the end the old bachelor and the school mistress fall in love with each other."},

Within a dozen pages, Galsworthy establishes his mastery of compelling narrative and sketches an irresistible plot. Much of his achievement lies in the mixture of pathos and humor that he derives from characters little able to express their feelings.

Published in 1913, the story also holds the fascination of a world about to be transformed by war--one in which a love letter could still be delivered by the hand of a discreet manservant, and the residents of Piccadilly kept their horses stabled close by so that they could gallop down to Richmond for fresh air."},

The rising tide, lapping slowly and gently in from the ocean, was floating the boats beached on the shingle, and was gradually driving back the crowd of barefooted children who had ventured out in search of mussels, and was sending them, shrieking with mirth, scampering up the seaweed-covered steps that led to the fish market. On the crag-top above the town the corn had been cut, and harvesters were busy laying the sheaves together in stooks. The yellow fields shone in the afternoon light as if the hill were crowned with gold. Walking along the narrow cobbled path that led past the harbour and up on to the cliff, Mavis and Merle looked at the scene around with that sense of rejoicing proprietorship with which we are wont to revisit the pet place of our adoption. It was two whole months since they had been in Chagmouth, and as they both considered the little town to be the absolute hub of the universe it was really a great event to find themselves once more in its familiar streets.

Her novels reflected the values and concerns of Anglo-Catholicism. She began writing in 1848, and published during her long life about 100 works, chiefly novels. Her first commercial success, The Heir of Redclyffe (1854), provided the funding to enable the schooner Southern Cross to be put into service on behalf of George Selwyn. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. She was also editor, for nearly forty years, of a magazine for young ladies, the Monthly Packet. Among the best known of her works are Heartsease; or, The Brother's Wife (1854), The Daisy Chain; or, Aspirations (1856), A History of Christian Names (1863, revised 1884), A Book of Golden Deeds (1864), The Dove in the Eagle's Nest (1866), Life of John Coleridge Patteson: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands (1873) and Hannah More (1888)."},

Traditionally the Philebus is interpreted as affirming the doctrine that the good resides in thought and mind rather than in pleasure or the body. Benardete challenges this view, arguing that Socrates vindicates the life of the mind over against the life of pleasure not by separating the two and advocating a strict asceticism, but by mixing pleasure and pain with mind in such a way that the philosophic life emerges as the only possible human life. Benardete combines a probing and challenging commentary that subtly mirrors and illumines the complexities of this dialogue with the finest English translation of the Philebus yet available. The result is a work that will be of great value to classicists, philosophers, and political theorists alike."},

Although it is set in Rome, the fictive world of The Marble Faun depends not on Italy's social or historical significance, but rather on its aesthetic importance as a definer of 'civilization'. As in The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne is concerned here with the nature of transgression and guilt. A murder, motivated by love, affects not only Donatello, the murderer, but his beloved Miriam and their friends Hilda and Kenyon. As he explores the reactions of each to the crime, Hawthorne dramatizes both the freedoms a new cultural model inspires and the self-censoring conformities it requires. His examination of the influence of European culture on American travellers lay the groundwork for such later works of American fiction as Mark Twain's The Innocents Abroad and Henry James' The Portrait of a Lady."},

Hitherto it was not easy to speak of Henri Fabre with exactitude. An enemy to all advertisement, he has so discreetly held himself withdrawn that one might almost say that he has encouraged, by his silence, many doubtful or unfounded rumours, which in course of time would become even more incorrect. For example, although quite recently his material situation was presented in the gloomiest of lights, while it had really for some time ceased to be precarious, it is nome the less true that during his whole life he has had to labour prodigiously in order to earn a little money to feed and rear his family, to the great detriment of his scientific inquiries; and we cannot but regret that he was not freed from all material cares at least twenty years earlier than was the case."},

Raw, Unsentimental, offering little comfort, viewing the working classes as condemned to a life in hell via industrialization, a life from which there is no hope of escape. It is one man's mordant vision--shaped by bitter personal experience of poverty--of the quality of life endured by a variety of characters in the nether world. With Zolaesque intensity and relentlessness, Gissing lays bare the economic forces which determine the aspirations and expectations of those born to a life of labour. This is a tale of intrigue, as rapacious schemers try to wrest a fortune out of a mysterious old man who has returned to their midst, and of thwarted love."},

What care we take about feeding the lucky body! Which of us does as much for his mind? And what causes the difference? Is the body so much the more important of the two?  By no means: but life depends on the body being fed, whereas we can continue to exist as animals (scarcely as men) though the mind be utterly starved and neglected. Therefore Nature provides that, in case of serious neglect of the body, such terrible consequences of discomfort and pain shall ensue, as will soon bring us back to a sense of our duty: and some of the functions necessary to life she does for us altogether, leaving us no choice in the matter. It would fare but ill with many of us if we were left to superintend our own digestion and circulation. 'Bless me!' one would cry, 'I forgot to wind up my heart this morning! To think that it has been standing still for the last three hours!' 'I can't walk with you this afternoon,' a friend would say, 'as I have no less than eleven dinners to digest. I had to let them stand over from last week, being so busy, and my doctor says he will not answer for the consequences if I wait any longer!'"},

In it will be openly seen the method that is the soul of our enterprise, our principles, our processes, our results. Under these three heads, the True, the Beautiful, the Good, we embrace psychology, placed by us at the head of all philosophy, aesthetics, ethics, natural right, even public right to a certain extent, finally theodicea, that perilous rendezvous of all systems, where different principles are condemned or justified by their consequences. It is the affair of our book to plead its own cause. We only desire that it may be appreciated and judged according to what it really is, and not according to an opinion too much accredited. We declare that eclecticism is very dear to us, for it is in our eyes the height of the history of philosophy; but the source of that light is elsewhere. Eclecticism is one of the most important and most useful applications of the philosophy which we teach, but it is not its principle. Our true doctrine, our true flag is spiritualism, that philosophy as solid as generous, which began with Socrates and Plato, which the Gospel has spread abroad in the world, and which Descartes put under the severe forms of modern genius.

The story concerns Augustus Melmotte, a French swindler and scoundrel, and his daughter, to whom Felix Carbury, adored son of the authoress Lady Carbury, is induced to propose marriage for the sake of securing a fortune. Trollope's portrait of Lady Carbury, impetuous, unprincipled, and unswervingly devoted to her own self-promotion, is one of his finest satirical achievements. In his kaleidoscopic depiction of a society on the verge of moral bankruptcy, Trollope gives us life as it was lived more than a hundred years ago, while speaking eloquently to some of the governing obsessions of our own age."},

From memoirs and biographies of notable military figures to firsthand accounts of famous battles and in-depth discussions of slavery, this collection is a remarkable opportunity for scholars and historians to rediscover the experience and impact of the Civil War. The volumes contained in the collection were all written within 60 years of the end of the war, which means that most authors had living memory of it and were facing the effects of the war while writing. These firsthand accounts allow the modern reader to more fully understand the culture of both the Union and Confederacy, the politics that governed the escalation and end of the war, the personal experience of life during the Civil War, and the most difficult and polarizing question in the history of the United States: slavery. The American Civil War Collection allows new readers access to the contemporary arguments and accounts surrounding the war, and is a vital new tool in understanding this important and pivotal chapter in American history."},

The prototypical GALAXY story (often parodied in the magazine itself) would take a present-day, often overlooked trend, fad or demographic fact and posit a society in which they had become dominant. Thus Fred Pohl's THE MIDAS PLAGUE in which obsessive consumerism and its unpleasant acquisitiveness had become negative social values. Thus Damon Knight's BACKWARD TURN BACKWARD in which the lifespan reversed (from grave to cradle) becomes a mockery of 1950's youth obsession. And thus THE BIG TRIP UP YONDER (January 1954) in which the increasing of the lifespan has led to a future America in which the old dominate simply because they will not die and yield their share of the diminishing stock of possessions...a circumstance which leads to the inevitable infantilism of the deprived younger generations. THE BIG TRIP UP YONDER is the second and last of the two stories which Kurt Vonnegut, a struggling mainstream writer and reluctant presence in science fiction, sold to GALAXY magazine. Characteristic of Vonnegut's work, it is framed as comedy but is deathly serious and confronts the issue of overextended mortality with unbending grimness. Vonnegut spent no more time hanging around the genre science fiction markets; it was another 18 years before THE BIG SPACE F--- appeared in AGAIN, DANGEROUS VISIONS and only did so because Vonnegut and that famous original anthology's editor, Harlan Ellison, were old friends."},

Set in the 1830s and 1840s, a period of rapid change and of political and economic development, the novel considers the fortunes and misfortunes of a 'most respectable' extended middle-class family. The action moves from London to Brighton, from England to France, from the political ambitions of an older generation in the industrial North to the painterly pretensions of a younger generation in Italy. At its cent re is Thomas Newcome, a retired Colonel in the Indian Army who finds the snobberies and hypocrisies of early Victorian England disconcerting. In a world of men on the make, of social mobility, and of the buying and selling of women in an aristocratic marriage market, it is the Colonel's distinctive but old-fashioned gentlemanliness that stands out from a self-seeking society."},

Although it is set in Rome, the fictive world of The Marble Faun depends not on Italy's social or historical significance, but rather on its aesthetic importance as a definer of 'civilization'. As in The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne is concerned here with the nature of transgression and guilt. A murder, motivated by love, affects not only Donatello, the murderer, but his beloved Miriam and their friends Hilda and Kenyon. As he explores the reactions of each to the crime, Hawthorne dramatizes both the freedoms a new cultural model inspires and the self-censoring conformities it requires. His examination of the influence of European culture on American travellers lay the groundwork for such later works of American fiction as Mark Twain's The Innocents Abroad and Henry James' The Portrait of a Lady."},

These firsthand accounts allow the modern reader to more fully understand the culture of both the Union and Confederacy, the politics that governed the escalation and end of the war, the personal experience of life during the Civil War, and the most difficult and polarizing question in the history of the United States: slavery.

Compelling, profound, complex, it is the story of a patricide and of the  four sons who each had a motive for murder: Dmitry, the sensualist,  Ivan, the intellectual; Alyosha, the mystic; and twisted, cunning  Smerdyakov, the bastard child. Frequently lurid, nightmarish, always  brilliant, the novel plunges the reader into a sordid love triangle, a  pathological obsession, and a gripping courtroom drama. But throughout  the whole, Dostoevsky searhes for the truth--about man, about life,  about the existence of God. A terrifying answer to man's eternal  questions, this monumental work remains the crowning achievement of  perhaps the finest novelist of all time."},

When the Malrive family, urged by Fanny's enigmatic sister-in-law, Madame de Treymes, agrees to a divorce, John must decide whether or not he will pursue a future with the woman he loves, but which forces her to give up her son.</ Contrasting the simplicity and practicality of John's brownstone in New York with the decadence and beauty of the Saint-Germain district of Paris, <Madame de Treymes</ intelligently examines the social role of women within two clashing cultures. The novella was inspired by Edith Wharton's own entrance into Parisian society, and remains one of her best-loved works of fiction.</ HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.

It was the first moment of contentment I had known for many weary months, and, needless to say, I set myself out to make the most of it. I was absolutely sick of tramping about. My left boot had burst and, by the feel of it, there wasn't too much left of my right sole. I had been crawling along the road since daylight - and for many days before, for that matter - searching for a job that failed to materialise. Jobs, it appeared, were just about as scarce as cool spots in Hades. They had been very kind to me at the last farmhouse. The good lady had given me an excellent breakfast and an extra glass of milk, had loaded my bedraggled pockets with food and had finally put me on the road to the sea. Work, she said, they could not give me. They had put off two men the previous day."},

There were no pictures on the walls, nor ornaments on the mantle pieces. For a time after my marriage with Mr. Smith, I did not think much about the plainness of our style of living; but after a while, contracts between my own parlors and those of one or two friends, would take place in my mind; and I often found myself wishing that we could afford a set of candelabras, a pair of china vases, or some choice pieces of Bohemian glass. In fact, I set my heart on something of the kind, though I concealed the weakness from my husband.

{"identifier": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27424", "description": "From the Publisher: One of Hilaire Belloc's most famous works, \"Cautionary Tales for Children\" satirizes a genre of admonitory children's literature popular in England in the late 18th and 19th centuries.  The seven stories contained in this work are macabre parodies of childhood lessons, and will entertain more sophisticated readers who can appreciate these tales of disproportionate punishment.  Presented in a classic picture book style, illustrators have captured the foibles of children like Jim, who let go of his nurse's hand and was eaten by a lion; Matilda, who told lies, and was burned to death; and Henry King who swallowed string.  The consequences range from naughty children being whimsically eaten by lions, to stern reprimands for a boy who fires a loaded gun at his sister.  Originally written nearly a century ago, Belloc's sprightly verses are a quick and cathartic read for teenagers, and reflect a trend of literature that is still popular today."},

It was the first time he had really looked at it since his return from France, and it made him homesick to see, even in its cold outlines, the familiar things and scenes which he had so loved as a scout. The hill trail was nothing but a dotted line, but Tom knew it for more than that, for it was along its winding way into the dark recesses of the mountains that he had qualified for the pathfinder's badge. Black Lake was just an irregular circle, but in his mind's eye he saw there the moonlight glinting up the water, and canoes gliding silently, and heard the merry voices of scouts diving from the springboard at its edge. He liked this map better than maps of billets and trenches, and to him the hill trail was more suggestive of adventure than the Hindenburg Line. He had been very close to the Hindenburg Line and it had meant no more to him than the equator. He had found the war to be like a three-ringed circus - it was too big. Temple Camp was about the right size. Tom reached for a slip of paper and laying it upon the map just where the trail went over the hilltop and off the camp territory altogether, jotted down the numbers of three cabins which were indicated by little squares."},

Like all persons of poetical or romantic temperament, he would prefer to believe in them. They would make life so much more interesting and exciting.

The poem tells the story of a chase to recapture a valuable colt. 'The Man' - who is not identified by name - rides down a suicidally steep slope to rescue the horse, collect the reward money and become a local hero. It is thought that the character of The Man from Snowy River was based on Jack Riley from Corryong, although a strong case has been made that 'the Man' is a composite character from a number of people Paterson met. The poem was written at a time when there was a groundswell of sentiment towards Australia as a new and distinct nation apart from the British Empire, and the bush settings and characters in poems by Paterson and Henry Lawson served to emphasise the growing 'difference' in national identity. Several films, a television series and a musical have been made from the story, proof of its enduring power to captivate Australia ns to this day."},

Leiber slyly imagines a near-future when giant machines not only harvest the wheat field, but grind flour and bake bread on the spot -- the ultimate in big farming. In this toasted tomorrow, the highly-mechanized Puffy Products is bent on producing the supremely lightest loaf. The story is what happens if bread isn't just airy, but pumped full of lighter-than-air helium.

The success of Aristotle's endeavour may be measured by the enormous impact of his ethics on Western moral philosophy through the centuries. Composed as mere lecture notes, it possesses a startling boldness and represents an exacting, exciting challenge to the reader. By converting ethics from a theoretical to a practical science, and by introducing psychology into his study of behaviour, Aristotle both widens the field of moral philosophy and simultaneously makes it more accessible to anyone who seeks an understanding of human nature. -Amazon.com."},

In treating the \"Nouveaux Essais\" of Leibniz, I have found myself obliged, at times, to violate the letter of this expressed intention, in order to fulfil its spirit. The \"Nouveaux Essais,\" in spite of its being one of the two most extended philosophical writings of Leibniz, is a compendium of comments, rather than a connected argument or exposition. It has all the suggestiveness and richness of a note-book, but with much also of its fragmentariness. I have therefore been obliged to supplement my account of it by constant references to the other writings of Leibniz, and occasionally to take considerable liberty with the order of the treatment of topics. Upon the whole, this book will be found, I hope, to be a faithful reflex not only of Leibniz's thought, but also of his discussions in the \"Nouveaux Essais.\" I have endeavored, in the body of the work, to identify my thought with that of Leibniz as much as possible, to assume his standpoint and method, and, for the most part, to confine express criticism upon his limitations to the final chapter. In particular, I have attempted to bring out the relations of philosophy to the growing science of his times, to state the doctrine of pre-established harmony as he himself meant it, and to give something like consistency and coherency to his doctrine of material existence and of nature. This last task seemed especially to require doing. I have also endeavored to keep in mind, throughout, Leibniz's relations to Locke, and to show the \"Nouveaux Essais\" as typical of the distinction between characteristic British and German thought\"--Preface.
